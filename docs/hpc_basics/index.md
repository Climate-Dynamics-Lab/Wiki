# High Performance Computing

The lab frequently uses supercomputers for data analysis and performing simulations.

A familiarity with [shell scripting](shell_scripting.md) and [Slurm](slurm.md) 
would be useful in general for using these. 

There is also specific information on getting started on the
three main HPCs we use in the lab:

* [Hypatia](hypatia.md): University of St Andrews supercomputer, useful for less intensive tasks such 
as running [Isca](../climate_models/isca.md) simulations.
* [Archer2](archer2.md): UK national supercomputer, useful for more intensive tasks such as 
running [CESM](../climate_models/cesm/index.md) simulations.
* [JASMIN](jasmin.md): UKs environmental data analysis platform, useful for data analysis
with large datasets such as [CESM](../data/cesm/index.md) or [ERA5](../data/era5/index.md).
