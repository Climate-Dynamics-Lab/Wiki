# Hypatia
The following gives some instructions on how to get an account on 
the University of St Andrews HPC called hypatia, and then login (based on Mac OS).

## Resources

* There is a [website](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/high-performance-computing/) for hypatia. 

* There is also a recorded 
[lecture](https://st-andrews.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cfe68199-3d75-42c5-97de-ad3b00f42710)
for the previous incarnation (kennedy).

* Corresponding 
[lecture notes](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/high-performance-computing/documents/kennedy_intro_June21.pdf).

These may be useful, especially if using an operating system other than *Mac*.

## Getting an account
- Register for an account [ðŸ”—](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/high-performance-computing/register/access.htm).
- Create a public ssh key.
    - Follow [these instructions](https://www.siteground.co.uk/kb/how_to_generate_an_ssh_key_pair_in_mac_os/).
    - I would not enter a password and leave the folder as the default.
    - You should have created a private key (*id_rsa*) and a public key (*id_rsa.pub*). For me, these were saved to 
    */Users/user/.ssh/*.
- Email the public key to Herbert (*herbert.fruchtl@st-andrews.ac.uk*) so he can make you an account.
    - He should then email you a username and password.

## Login
!!! note "Username"
	Your hypatia username will probably be the same as your normal St Andrews one. In the following, I have left 
	my username, *jamd1*, so just replace this wherever it appears with your username.

-  Unless you are in a University building or a student hall, you need to [connect to the St Andrews VPN](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/it-support/services/wifi/vpn/).
- To login, run the following in terminal (the IP address may be replaced by a host name in the future).
```bash
ssh jamd1@138.251.14.231
```
- You may get the following message:
```bash
The authenticity of host can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is ...
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
If so, just say `yes`
- Then it will call for the password:
      ```bash
      jamd1@138.251.14.231's password:
      ```

    cd null
    SLURM: Your account, jamd1, is ready to submit Slurm jobs.
    Info: Loaded slurm into the modular environment.
    Info: Loaded lmod into the modular environment.
    ```

## Change Password
On first login, the password should be changed using the command `passwd`:
```bash
[jamd1@login01(standrews) ~]$ passwd
Changing password for user jamd1.
Current Password: 
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[jamd1@login01(standrews) ~]$ 
```

## File Transfer
??? note "Using Terminal"
    You can exchange files between your local computer and hypatia using terminal:
    ```bash
    sftp jamd1@138.251.14.231
    jamd1@138.251.14.231's password: 
    Connected to 138.251.14.231.
    sftp> 
    ```

    - Then use `cd <dir>` to change directory
    - `put <file>` to move file from local computer to hypatia.
    - `get <file>` to move file from hypatia to local computer.

I find it easiest to exchange files using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) which has a graphical interface.

- Download it from this [website](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client#close)
- Next, you need to specify the private key which was [created earlier](#getting-an-account).
    - In FileZilla, in the top bar, click *Edit* and then *Settings*.
    - Then click *Connection/SFTP* and then *Add key file*.
    - Select the private key [created earlier](#getting-an-account) i.e. it should be called *id_rsa*. <br>
    ![image.png](images/hypatia/private_key.png){width="300"}
    - Then press *OK* <br>
    ![image.png](images/hypatia/private_key_confirm.png){width="300"}
    - This comes from the *On a Mac* section on the [wiki](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Howto#On_a_Mac). 

- Now, in the top bar, click *File* and then *Site Manager*
    - Create a *New Site* for *hypatia*.
    - Protocol: *SFTP*
    - Host: *138.251.14.231*
    - Username and password is the same as used to [login](#login). <br>
    ![image.png](images/hypatia/site_manager.jpg){width="300"}
    - Then click *Connect* and it should hopefully work with a screen like the following appearing. <br>
    ![image.png](images/hypatia/connect.jpg){width="300"}
- You should now be able to drag and drop files from the local computer (left) to hypatia (right) and create new 
directories etc.

## CONDA
### Installation
To install *CONDA*, [login](#login) and then run `install-conda` in terminal.
This should then produce some files in the location */gpfs01/software/conda/jamd1/conda*: <br>
 ![image.png](images/hypatia/conda.jpg){width="300"}

### Create Environment
To create a `python 3.9` conda environment called `test_env` run:
```bash
conda create -n test_env python=3.9
```
Then to activate it, run:
```bash
conda activate test_env
```
Terminal should then look something like this:
```
(test_env) [jamd1@login01(standrews) ~]$
```
### Error - Wrong Python Version
???+ error
    If you now run `python -V` to check the python version, it will print `Python 2.7.5` even though the conda 
    environment is `python 3.9`.
    
    This is because it is using the wrong python. If you run `which python`, it will print `/usr/bin/python` which 
    has nothing to do with the `test_env` *CONDA* environment.
    
    The problem is that the python installed using *CONDA* does not have execution permissions, so it reverts to 
    a python version which does. To give execution permissions, you can run the following line (The `$USER` will 
    automatically be your username so you don't need to change it):
    ```bash
    chmod u+x /gpfs01/software/conda/$USER/conda/envs/*/bin/*
    ```

    If you now run `conda deactivate` and then `conda activate test_env` to log out and then back into the *CONDA* 
    environment, `python -V` should now print `Python 3.9.13` and `which python` should print </br>
    `/gpfs01/software/conda/jamd1/conda/envs/test_env/bin/python`.

    In general, whenever you hit a `Permission Denied` error when using a *CONDA* environment, I would run 
    `chmod u+x /gpfs01/software/conda/$USER/conda/envs/*/bin/*` as a first attempt at fixing it.
