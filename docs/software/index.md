# Software
Information on software that is useful for the lab.

## Integrated Development Environment
In the lab, we do a lot of data analysis using Python, 
both locally and on [JASMIN](../hpc_basics/jasmin.md). To streamline this process,
it is useful to have an IDE where you can do everything. Some options are listed below:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Probably the most popular choice
* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Pretty good alternative, they have a free [student pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/)
as well.
* [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en): Like VS Code but more focused on AI. Students get [one year free](https://cursor.com/students).
Not sure if it has [support for Jupyter notebooks](https://forum.cursor.com/t/jupyter-notebook-support/14851) 
yet, though.

## Python
Here we provide some useful libraries to use for Python.

### `climdyn_tools`

[This](../code/index.md) is a package containing code created by members of the lab.

### `xarray`

Most of our data analysis is performed by manipulating xarray `Datasets` in Jupyter notebooks.

## Organisation
Here are some useful applications for writing as well as keeping track of research, literature.

### Microsoft Teams
This is where we organize group meetings and share interesting results.

### Zotero
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, open-source reference manager that helps you collect, organize, and cite research materials.
They have a useful [web extension](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors). 
We also have a shared lab library to keep track of papers we have discussed as a group.

### Overleaf
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is useful for writing up papers.

### Diary
It is useful to have a diary to keep notes day to day. 

I use [logseq](https://logseq.com/) as it is free, open source,
and you write in Markdown which is easy to use. It is also easy to embed equations in LaTeX, as well as images.
It is probably easiest to use this as a diary but allows for much more complexity with tags and links.

Alternatives to this include [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I think
all three of these support [Zotero](#zotero) integration as well.
