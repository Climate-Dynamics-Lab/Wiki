# Integrated Development Environment
In the lab, we do a lot of data analysis using Python, 
both locally and in [JASMIN](../hpc_basics/jasmin.md). To streamline this process,
it is useful to have an IDE which you can do everything. Some options are listed below:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Probably the most popular choice
* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Pretty good alternative, they have a free  [student pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/)
as well.
* [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en): Like VS Code but more focussed on AI. Students get [one year free](https://cursor.com/students).
